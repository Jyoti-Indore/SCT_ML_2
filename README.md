# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

This project is a part of my Skillcraft Technology internship and was developed as Task 2 under the project name `SCT_ML_2`. It involves the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. The objective is to help businesses identify distinct groups of customers for targeted marketing strategies.

## 🔍 Project Objective

The main aim of this project is to:
- Segment customers into meaningful groups based on their behavior and demographics.
- Use clustering techniques to identify patterns within the customer data.
- Visualize the clusters for better interpretation and decision-making.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for clustering - KMeans)

## Dataset Used
-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values (if any)  
   - Scaled features for uniformity  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

2. **Clustering Algorithm**  
   - Applied KMeans clustering  
   - Used Elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters  
   - Cluster interpretation and labeling

3. **Visualization**  
   - 2D visualization of clusters using features like `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`.

## 📚 Knowledge Gained

- Hands-on experience with unsupervised learning (KMeans)
- Real-world data preprocessing and analysis
- EDA and feature engineering
- Model evaluation using inertia and elbow method
- Data visualization techniques


## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Try other clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- Add more features to improve segmentation
- Build a simple dashboard for business teams
